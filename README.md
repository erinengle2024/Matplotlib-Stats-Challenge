# Data Visualization Challenge
Welcome to my submission for the Visualization-Challenge in module 5 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in the matplotlib library and using visualization tools in Jupyter Lab.
# Challenge Description
In this challenge, our objective was to create a report using two separate CSV files—based on a pharmaceutical company testing cancer treatments on  lab rats.  Below, you'll find the detailed requirements of the challenge.<img width="1124" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 10 36 09 PM" src="https://github.com/erinengle2024/Matplotlib-Stats-Challenge/assets/158017994/1389b4d1-b1fb-488d-8cfb-f1b2f22e7627">

  ADD LATER AFTER TESTING RESULTS!!

 # My Analysis

249 rats were monitored with growing tumors for 45 days, and given 10 different treatments, including a placebo. The test included a nearly equal amount of males and females, all ranging in age from 1 month to 24 months. The study revealed a strong correlation between weight and tumor volume, with the correlation coefficient being 0.84. Of the treatments, the 4 most notable was 'Capomulin', 'Ramicane', 'Infubinol', and 'Ceftamin'. Capomulin was the treatment plan of interest, which resulted in an average tumor volume of 40.68 mm3, and a median of roughly 41.56 mm3. Interestingly, Ramicane performed slightly better than Capomulin, with a slightly lower average tumor volume of 40.22 mm3, and a median of roughly 40.67 mm3. Comparatively, while Infubinol displayed a larger tumor volume average of 52.88 mm3, it indicated 31 potential outliers, that nearly matched the volume sizes of Ramicane and Capomulin. These findings suggest either success with the drug or potential discrepancies in drug administration or data recording, all warranting further investigation.
